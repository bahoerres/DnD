## Kalashtar Fey Wanderer Ranger / Circle of Spores Druid

  
**Background**: Far Traveler  

**Primary Class**: Ranger (Fey Wanderer)  

**Secondary Class**: Druid (Circle of Spores)  

**Companion**: Two-Headed Pseudodragon (Nyx and Lux)

  

### Background/Origin Story

  

**Backstory**:

Kaelen was born in a remote village nestled deep within an ancient forest. The village was a sanctuary for those who sought a life in harmony with nature. Raised by a community of druids from the Circle of Spores, Kaelen learned to appreciate the delicate balance between life and decay, harnessing the power of spores to heal and protect.

  

Among the druids was a seasoned Fey Wanderer Ranger named Elarian, who took a special interest in Kaelen. Elarian saw potential in the young Kalashtar, recognizing a kindred spirit connected to the mystical energies of the Feywild. Under Elarian's tutelage, Kaelen learned the ways of the ranger, mastering the arts of stealth, survival, and enchantment. This dual training allowed Kaelen to develop a unique blend of druidic and ranger abilities, making him a versatile and powerful protector of the natural world.

  

However, Kaelen's peaceful life was shattered when a dark force descended upon the village. In a desperate attempt to defend his home, Kaelen faced a creature of unimaginable terror. Though victorious, the battle left him scarred both physically and mentally. The encounter with darkness shook Kaelen's faith and blurred his once-clear sense of right and wrong.

  

Seeking redemption and a deeper understanding of the balance between life and death, Kaelen journeyed to a secluded monastery known for its teachings of the Way of the Long Death. There, he learned to embrace the inevitability of death, harnessing its power to protect and inspire fear in his enemies. This training, combined with his druidic and ranger skills, transformed Kaelen into a formidable warrior with a unique perspective on life and death.

  

Kaelen travels with his loyal companion, a two-headed Pseudodragon named Nyx and Lux, each head representing the duality of his nature—light and darkness, life and death.
